--- abstract

This document specifies Secure Reliable Transport (SRT) protocol. 
SRT is a user-level protocol over User Datagram Protocol and provides 
reliability and security optimized for low latency live video streaming, 
as well as generic bulk data transfer. For this, SRT introduces control
packet extension, improved flow control, enhanced congestion control
and a mechanism for data encryption.

# Packet Structure

SRT packets are transmitted in UDP packets {{RFC0768}}. Every UDP packet carrying SRT 
traffic contains an SRT header (immediately after the UDP header).

F (1 bit): 
: Packet Type Flag. The control packet has this flag set to "1".
  The data packet has this flag set to "0".

Timestamp (32 bits):
: The time stamp of the packet in microseconds.
  The value is relative to the time the SRT connection was established.
  Depending on the transmission mode ({{data-transmission-mode}}),
  the field stores the packet send time or the packet origin time.

Destination Socket ID (32 bits):
: A fixed-width field providing the SRT socket ID to which a packet should be dispatched.
  The field may have the special value "0" when the packet is a connection request.

Packet Sequence Number (31 bits):
: The sequential number of the data packet.

PP (2 bits):
: Packet Position Flags. This field indicates the position of the data packet in the message.
  The value "10b" means the first packet of the message. "00b" indicates a packet in the middle,
  "01b" is the last packet. If a single data packet forms the whole message,
  the value is "11b".

O (1 bit):
: Order Flag. Indicates whether the message should be delivered by the receiver
  in order (1) or not (0). Certain restrictions apply depending on the data transmission mode used ({{data-transmission-mode}}).

KK (2 bits):
: Encryption Flag. The flag bits indicate whether or not data is encrypted.
  The value "00b" means data is not encrypted, "01b" indicates that data is
  encrypted with even key, and "11b" is used for odd key encryption. Refer to {{encryption}}.

R (1 bit):
: Retransmitted Packet Flag. This flag is clear when a packet is transmitted the very first time.
  The flag set to "1" means the packet is retransmitted.

Message Number (26 bits):
: The sequential number of the message formed by consecutive data packets (see PP field).

Data (variable length):
: The payload of the data packet. The length of the data is the remaining length of the UDP packet.

# SRT Data Transmission and Control

After handshakes and exchanges of capability information, packet data 
can be sent and received over the established connection. To fully utilize 
the features of low latency and error recovery provided by SRT, the sender 
and receiver MUST handle control packets, timers and buffers for the connection
as specified in this section.

## Stream Multiplexing

Multiple SRT socket may share one UDP socket and the packets received to this
UDP socket will be correctly dispatched to the SRT socket to which they are
currently destined.
During the handshake, the parties exchange their SRT Socket IDs.
These IDs are then used in the Destination Socket ID field of every control and data packet.

## Data Transmission Modes {#data-transmission-mode}

In file transfer mode this a message with O=0 that is sent later
(but reassembled before an earlier message which may be incomplete due to packet loss)
is allowed to be delivered immediately, without waiting for the earlier message to be completed.
In Live Transmission Mode the only valid value is "1".

### Message Mode {#transmission-mode-msg}

When the STREAM flag of the handshake Extension Message Flags is set to 0,
the protocol operates in the message mode.

Every packet has its own Packet Sequence Number.
One or several consecutive SRT Data packet can form a message.
In that case all the packets belonging to the same message have similar
message number set in the Message Number field.

The first packet of the message has the first bit of the Packet Position Flags ({{data-pkt}})
set to 1. The last packet of the message has the second bit of the Packet Position Flags
set to 1. Thus, PP equal to "11b" indicates a packet that forms the whole message.
The PP field equal to "00b" indicates a packet that belongs to the inner part of the message.

The concept of the message in SRT comes from UDT ({{I-D.gg-udt}}).
In this mode a single sending instruction passes exactly one piece of data
that has boundaries (a message). This message may span across multiple UDP packets
(and multiple SRT data packets). The only size limitation is that it shall fit as a whole
in the buffers of the sender and the receiver.
Although internally all the operations on data packets (ACK, NAK) are performed independently,
it is only allowed for an application to send and receive the whole message.
Until the message is complete (all packets are received) it will not be allowed to read it.

The Order Flag of the Data packet set to 1 restricts the reading order of the messages to be sequential.
While the Order Flag set to 0 allows to read those messages that are already fully available, before
preceding messages, that still have some packets missing.

### Live mode {#transmission-mode-live}

Live mode is a special case of the message mode where only data packets
with PP field set to "11b" are allowed.

Additionally TsbPd ({{tsbpd}}) and TL Packet drop ({{tl-pkt-drop}}) mechanisms are used in this mode.

### Buffer mode {#transmission-mode-buffer}

Buffer mode is negotiated during the Handshake by setting the STREAM flag
of the handshake Extension Message Flags to 1.

In this mode the consecutive packets form one consecutive stream that can be read with
the portions of any size.

## Handshake Messages {#handshake-messages}

SRT is a connection protocol. It embraces the concepts of "connection"
and "session". The UDP system protocol is used by SRT for sending data
and control packets.

An SRT connection is characterized by the fact that it is:

- first engaged by a handshake process

- maintained as long as any packets are being exchanged in a timely manner

- considered closed when a party receives the appropriate close command from
  its peer (connection closed by the foreign host), or when it receives no
  packets at all for some predefined time (connection broken on timeout).

SRT supports two connection configurations:

1. Caller-Listener, where one side waits for the other to initiate a connection
2. Rendezvous, where both sides attempt to initiate a connection

The handshake is performed between two parties: "Initiator" and "Responder":

- Initiator starts the extended SRT handshake process and sends appropriate
  SRT extended handshake requests;

- Responder expects the SRT extended handshake requests to be sent by the
  Initiator and sends SRT extended handshake responses back.

There are two basic types of SRT handshake extensions that are exchanged
in the handshake:

- Handhshake Extension Message exchanges the basic SRT information;
- Key Material Exchange exchanges the wrapped stream encryption key (used only if
  encryption is requested).

The Initiator and Responder roles are assigned depending on the connection mode.

For Caller-Listener connections: the Caller is the Initiator,
the Listener is the Responder.
For Rendezvous connections: the Initiator and Responder roles are assigned
based on the initial data interchange during the handshake.

The Handshake Type field in the Handshake Structure (see {{handshake-packet-structure}}) 
indicates the handshake message type.

Caller-Listener handshake exchange has the following order of Handshake Types:

1. Caller to Listener: INDUCTION
2. Listener to Caller: INDUCTION (reports cookie)
3. Caller to Listener: CONCLUSION (uses previously returned cookie)
4. Listener to Caller: CONCLUSION (confirms connection established)

Rendezvous handshake exchange has the following order of Handshake Types:

1. After starting the connection: `URQ_WAVEAHAND`
2. After receiving the above message from the peer: `URQ_CONCLUSION`
3. After receiving the above message from the peer: `URQ_AGREEMENT`.

In case when the connection process has failed when the party was about to
send the CONCLUSION handshake, the Handshake Type field will contain appropriate
error value. See the list of error codes in {{hs-rej-reason}}.

 | Code | Rejection Reason | Description       |
 | ---- | :--------------: | :---------------: |
 | 1000 | REJ_UNKNOWN      | Unknown reason    |
 | 1001 | REJ_SYSTEM       | System function error       |
 | 1002 | REJ_PEER         | Rejected by peer            |
 | 1003 | REJ_RESOURCE     | Resource allocation problem |
 | 1004 | REJ_ROGUE        | incorrect data in handshake |
 | 1005 | REJ_BACKLOG      | listener's backlog exceeded |
 | 1006 | REJ_IPE          | internal program error |
 | 1007 | REJ_CLOSE        | socket is closing |
 | 1008 | REJ_VERSION      | peer is older version than agent's minimum set |
 | 1009 | REJ_RDVCOOKIE    | rendezvous cookie collision |
 | 1010 | REJ_BADSECRET    | wrong password |
 | 1011 | REJ_UNSECURE     | password required or unexpected |
 | 1012 | REJ_MESSAGEAPI   | Stream flag collision |
 | 1013 | REJ_CONGESTION   | incompatible congestion-controller type |
 | 1014 | REJ_FILTER       | incompatible packet filter |
 | 1015 | REJ_GROUP        | incompatible group |
{: #hs-rej-reason title="HS Rejection Reason Codes"}

The specification of `PBKEYLEN` is decided by the Sender. When the transmission 
is bidirectional, this value must be agreed upon at the outset because when both 
are set, the Responder wins. For Caller-Listener connections it is reasonable to 
set this value on the Listener only. In the case of Rendezvous the only reasonable 
approach is to decide upon the correct value from the different sources and to 
set it on both parties (note that **AES-128** is the default).

### Caller-Listener Handshake {#caller-listener-handshake}

This section describes the handshaking process where a Listener is
waiting for an incoming Handshake request on a bound UDP port from a Caller.
The process has two phases: induction and conclusion.

#### The Induction Phase

The Caller begins by sending an "induction" message, which contains the following
(significant) fields:

- Version: must always be 4
- Encryption Field: 0
- Extension Field: 2
- Handshake Type: INDUCTION
- SRT Socket ID: SRT Socket ID of the Caller
- SYN Cookie: 0

The Destination Socket ID of the SRT packet header in this message is 0, which is
interpreted as a connection request.

NOTE: The handshake version number is set to 4 in this initial handshake.
It is due to the initial design of SRT that was to be compliant with the UDT
protocol ({{I-D.gg-udt}}) it is based on.

NOTE: This phase serves only to set a cookie on the Listener so that it
doesn't allocate resources, thus mitigating a potential DOS attack that might be
perpetrated by flooding the Listener with handshake commands.

The Listener responds with the following:

- Version: 5
- Encryption Field: Advertised cipher family and block size.
- Extension Field: SRT magic code 0x4A17
- Handshake Type: INDUCTION
- ID: Socket ID of the HSv5 Listener
- SYN Cookie: a cookie that is crafted based on host, port and current time
  with 1 minute accuracy

NOTE: At this point the Listener still doesn't know if the Caller is SRT or UDT,
and it responds with the same set of values regardless of whether the Caller is
SRT or UDT.

If the party is SRT, it does interpret the values in Version and Type.
If it receives the value 5 in Version, it understands that it comes from an SRT
party, so it knows that it should prepare the proper handshake messages
phase. It also checks the following:

- whether the Extension Flags contains the magic value 0x4A17; otherwise the
  connection is rejected. This is a contingency for the case where someone who,
  in an attempt to extend UDT independently, increases the Version value to 5
  and tries to test it against SRT.

- whether the Encryption Flags contain a non-zero
  value, which is interpreted as an advertised cipher family and block size.

The legacy UDT party completely ignores the values reported in Version and
Handshake Type.  It is, however, interested in the SYN Cookie value, as this must be
passed to the next phase. It does interpret these fields, but only in the "conclusion" message.

### Rendezvous Handshake

Rendezvous handshake exchange has the following order of Handshake Types:

1. After starting the connection: `URQ_WAVEAHAND`
2. After receiving the above message from the peer: `URQ_CONCLUSION`
3. After receiving the above message from the peer: `URQ_AGREEMENT`.

## SRT Buffer Latency

The sender and receiver have buffers to store packets.
On the sender, latency is the time that SRT holds a packet to give it a chance to be
delivered successfully while maintaining the rate of the sender at the receiver.
If an ACK is missing or late for the configured latency, the packet is dropped
from the sender buffer. The packet can be retransmitted, while the packet exists
in the buffer for the latency window. On the receiver, a packet delivered to an 
application from a buffer after latency time passed, to recover from a potential
packet loss. 

Latency is a value specified in milliseconds, which can cover hundreds or even thousands
of packets at high bitrate. Latency can be thought of as a window that slides over time,
during which a number of activities take place, such as report of ACKs({{packet-acks}})
or NAKs({{packet-naks}}).
Latency is configured through capability exchange during extended handshake process 
between initiator and responder. The handshake extension({{handshake-extension-msg}}) has 
receiver and sender TsbPd Delay information in milliseconds. The maximum value of latencies
from initiator and responder will be established. 

## Timestamp Based Packet Delivery {#tsbpd}

This feature uses the timestamp of the SRT data packet header.
TsbPD allows a receiver to deliver packets to the decoder at the same pace they were
provided to the SRT sender by an encoder. Basically, the sender timestamp
in the received packet is adjusted to the receiver’s local time
(compensating for time drift or different time zone)
before releasing the packet to the application.
Packets can be withheld by SRT for a configured receiver delay in milliseconds.
Higher delay can accommodate data traffic which could lead to a larger uniform packet drop
rate or larger packet burst drop.
Packets received after their “play time” are dropped.
The packet timestamp (in microseconds) is relative to the SRT connection creation time.
The origin time (in microseconds) of the packet is already sampled when a packet is first
submitted by the application to the SRT sender.
The TsbPD feature uses this time to stamp the packet for first transmission
and any subsequent re-transmission. This timestamp and the configured latency
control the recovery buffer size and the instant (aforementioned "play time"
which is decided by adding timestamp to configured latency) that packets 
are delivered at the destination.
Latency is agreed during handshake process as maximum value of Receiver/Sender TsbPd Delay
from initiator/responder (see section #ctrl-pkt-handshake).  

## Too-Late-Packet-Drop {#tl-pkt-drop}

Too-Late-Packet Drop allows the sender to drop packets that have no chance to be delivered in time.
In the SRT sender, when Too-Late Packet Drop is enabled, and a packet timestamp
is older than 125% of the SRT latency, it is considered too late to be delivered and may be dropped
by the sender. Packets of an IFrame tail can then be dropped before being delivered.
In the receiver, tail packets of a big I-Frame may be quite late and not held by the SRT receive buffer.
They pass through to the application. The receiver buffer depletes and there is no time left
for retransmission if missing packets are discovered. Missing packets are then skipped by the receiver.

## Acknowledgement and Lost Packet Handling

To enable the Automatic Repeat Request of data packet retransmissions, the sender stores
all sent data packets in its buffer.
The data receiver sends acknowledgement (ACK) for the received data packets so that the sender can remove
acknowledged packets from its buffer. After that retransmission of these acknowledged packets
are no longer possible and presumably not needed.

The sender should acknowledge the reception of the Full ACK control packet ({{ctrl-pkt-ack}})
by sending the ACKACK control packet ({{ctrl-pkt-ackack}}) with the sequence number
of the Full ACK packet being acknowledged.

The receiver sends NAK control packets to notify the sender about the missing packets.
The NAK packet sending can be triggered immediately after a gap in sequence numbers of
DATA packets is detected.
In addition to that, the Periodic NAK report mechanism can be used to send NAK reports periodically.
The NAK packet in that case will have all the packets that the receiver considers being lost
at the time of the Periodic NAK report.

Upon reception of the NAK packet, the sender prioritizes retransmissions of lost packets over the regular DATA
packets to be transmitted for the first time.

The retransmission of the missing packet is repeated until the receiver acknowledges its receival,
or if both peers agree to drop this packet (see {{tl-pkt-drop}}).

### Packet Acknowledgement (ACKs) {#packet-acks}

At certain intervals (see ACKs, ACKACKs & Round Trip Time), the receiver sends an ACK that
causes the acknowledged packets to be removed from the sender's buffer.
An ACK contains the sequence number of the packet immediately
following the latest of the previous packets that have been received. Where no packet loss has
occurred up to the packet with sequence number n, ACK would include the sequence number n + 1.
The ACK needs to acknowledged by ACKACK (see ACKACK), and if not the ACK will be retransmitted.
If the sender doesn't receive an ACK, it doesn't stop transmitting. There are two conditions
for sending an acknowledgement. A full ACK is based on a timer of 10 milliseconds (the ACK period).
For high bit rate transmissions, a “light ACK” can be sent, which is an ACK for
a sequence of packets. In a 10 milliseconds interval, there are often so many packets being sent
and received that the ACK position on the sender doesn't advance quickly enough.
To mitigate this, after 64 packets (even if the ACK period has not fully elapsed) the receiver
sends a light ACK. When a receiver encounters the situation where the next packet to be played was
not successfully received from the sender, it will “skip” this packet and send a fake ACK. To the
sender, this fake ACK is a real ACK, and so it just behaves as if the packet had been received.

This facilitates the synchronization between sender and receiver. The fact that a packet was
skipped remains unknown by the sender. Skipped packets are recorded in the statistics on the
receiver.

### Packet Retransmission (NAKs) {#packet-naks}

When a packet is received but the previous packets are not yet arrived in a receiver buffer,
if a certain amount of time is passed, NAKs for previous packets are sent to the sender.
If periodic NAK report is enabled in live mode, the lost packets list is sent periodically. 
The period is 4 * RTT + RTTVar + SYN, but this could be reduced (e.g. by half)
when a certain condition is met.  

The sender maintains a list of lost packets (loss list) that is built from NAK reports. When
scheduling to transmit, it looks to see if a packet in the loss list has priority, and will send it.
Otherwise, it will send the next packet in the sender buffer. Note that when a packet is transmitted,
it stays in the buffer in case it is not received.
NAK packets are processed to fill the loss list. As the latency window advances and packets are
dropped from the sender buffer, a check is performed to see if any of the dropped or resent
packets are in the loss list, to determine if they can be removed from there as well so that they
are not retransmitted unnecessarily.

What the sender sees is the NAKs that it has received. There is a counter for the packets that
are resent. If there is no ACK for a packet, it will stay in the loss list and can be resent more than
once. Packets in the loss list are prioritized.
If packets in the loss list continue to block the send queue, at some point this will cause the
send queue to fill. When the send queue is full, the sender will begin to drop packets without
even sending them the first time. An encoder (or other application) may continue to provide
packets, but there's no place for them, so they will end up being thrown away.

This condition where packets are unsent doesn't happen often. There is a maximum number of
packets held in the send buffer based on the configured latency. Older packets that have no
chance to be retransmitted and played in time are dropped, making room for newer real-time
packets produced by the sending application. A minimum of one second is applied before
dropping the packet when low latency is configured. This one-second limit derives from the
behavior of MPEG I-frames with SRT used as transport. I-frames are very large (typically 8 times
larger than other packets), and consequently take more time to transmit. They can be too large
to keep in the latency window, and can cause packets to be dropped from the queue. To
prevent this, SRT imposes a minimum of one second (or the latency value) before dropping a
packet. This allows for large I-frames when using small latency values.

### Packet Acknowledgment in SRT

The ACKACK tells the receiver to stop sending the ACK position because the sender already
knows it. Otherwise, ACKs (with outdated information) would continue to be sent regularly.
An ACK serves as a ping, with a corresponding ACKACK pong, to measure RTT.
The time it takes for an ACK to be sent and an ACKACK to be received is the RTT.
Each ACK has a number. A corresponding ACKACK has that same number.
The receiver keeps a list of all ACKs in a queue to match them. Unlike a full ACK,
which contains the current RTT and several other values in the CIF,
a light ACK just contains the sequence number. All control messages are sent directly and
processed upon reception, but ACKACK processing time is negligible (the time this takes
is included in the round-trip time).

### Bidirectional Transmission Queues

Once an SRT connection is established, both peers can send data packets simultaneously.

### Round Trip Time Estimation

The round-trip time is estimated during the transmission of SRT data packets
based on the time difference between the ACK packet is sent and the
corresponding ACKACK is received by the data receiver.

# Security Considerations

SRT support confidentiality of user data using stream ciphering based on AES,
as specified in {{encryption}}. Session key for ciphering is delivered control
packet during handshake, with the protection by Key encryption key,
which is generated by a sender and receiver with pre-shared secret such as passphrase.
Appropriate security policy including key size, key refresh period,
as well as passphrase should be managed by security officers,
which is out of scope of the present document.
Other security considerations related to ciphering scheme and key exchanges
are described in {{encryption}}.

# Packet Sequence List coding {#packet-seq-list-coding}

For any single packet sequence number,
it uses the original sequence number in the field. The first bit 
must start with "0".

For any consectutive packet seqeunce numbers that the differnece between
the last and first is more than 1, only record the first (a) and the
the last (b) sequence numbers in the list field, and modify the
the first bit of a to "1".
